# cryptotracker

cryptotracker is a web app for viewing a list of top performing cryptocurrencies by market volume. users can add currencies they are interested in to a watchlist. users can also make some conversions from selected currencies to crypto coins.

users can be sure of up-to-date data on the app as current currency and crypto data are fetched before each conversion.   

i created this project to sharpen my vue skills. some vue specific technologies i use here are vue router and vuex.
